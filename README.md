# LMS Dashboard Backend

This repository contains the backend codebase for the Learning Management System (LMS) Dashboard project. The backend is developed using Node.js with Express.js, MongoDB for database management, Firebase Authentication for user authentication, and integrated payment systems for course enrollment.

## Project Overview

- **Firebase Authentication:** Manage user registration and authentication securely.
- **MongoDB Integration:** Store course information, user data, and payment details.
- **API Endpoints:** Implement CRUD operations for courses, users, and payments with authentication middleware.
- **Payment Integration:** Integrate a payment system (e.g., Stripe) for course enrollment.
